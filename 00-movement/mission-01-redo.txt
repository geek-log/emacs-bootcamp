   Description: Emacs does not include a 'redo' command, you must break the
   'undo-ring' to perform a redo action.

   Your ORDERS:
     - At the end of the BRAVO line append one extra Os, it must be BRAVOO.
     - Undo the extra O appending by pressing C-x u.
     - Now, how do you redo?: Do something else first, NOW PRESS C-n.
     - Now press C-x u again to make the undo action works as a redo.
