of how Emacs treats a paragraph and, of course, to entertain you.

From now on you will speak only when spoken to, and the first and last words
out of your filthy sewers will be 'Sir.' Do you maggots understand that?

GOLF
These are great days we're living, bros. We are jolly green giants,

we're gonna miss not having anyone around that's worth shooting.
