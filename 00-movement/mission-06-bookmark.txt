EMACS BOOTCAMP
============================================================================

Hello recruit and welcome to the Emacs bootcamp program.

Mission #06: Bookmarks and Registers.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Definitions
...........................................................................

Bookmark: Think as the bookmarks of your web browser but can include: web
          pages, directories, files, man pages and others. The bookmarks
          are permanent and are stored on the file ~/.emacs.d/bookmarks.

Register: The registers allows to store text and positions inside the buffer
          but in contrast with the bookmarks, they are trasient, this means
          that they dissapear when Emacs is closed. The registers are
          'one-character-store'. They can store positions on the buffer,
          regions of text (selected text) and numbers.
