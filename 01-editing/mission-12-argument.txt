EMACS BOOTCAMP
============================================================================

Hello recruit and welcome to the Emacs bootcamp program.

Now that you can run all the laps without losing your breath we'll advance
to specialize your abilities.

Mission #12: Kill a lot of them!!!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Briefing
............................................................................

On this mission you will learn how to kill using numeric arguments, both
positive and negative.

When using editing commands, is possible to pass numeric arguments to them,
this will execute the command multiple times (similarly to the movement
commands).

If you pass a negative argument to the command, then it will be executed in
the opposed direction. You can use the '-' symbol to indicate a '-1' value or
use a explicit value like '-2'.

Definitions
............................................................................

Tempo: The 'Emacs Tempo' is the ability of use the minimal hands movement
       when using Emacs commands, think of a piano player using the hands
       close to the keys for optimal performance.

Mission
............................................................................

01) Passing positive numerical arguments to a command:

    ORDERS:
      - Read all instructions first.

      - Go to the ALPHA line and press C-a.

      - Let's inspect the command 'M-@' that is used to select words. The
        first part of that command is 'M-' (without the '@'), press 'M-2'
        NOW and WATCH the minibuffer, the text 'C-u 2-' appears on it, if
        you remember from previous missions, the keybinding 'C-u' is the
        "Universal Argument", this is the argument used to tell Emacs the
        number of times to execute a command.

      - Press M-@, the words ALPHA and BRAVO must be selected now.

      - Press C-g to cancel.

      - Go to the DELTA line and press C-a.

      - Press M-f to skip the DELTA word.

      - Now let's inspect the command 'C-M-k' that kills a balanced
        expression (s-expression), the first part of the command is
        'C-M-' (without the 'k'), press 'C-M-2' NOW and WATCH the minibuffer,
        the text 'C-u 2-' is displayed again, see? there are many ways to
        pass an argument and we must use the one that allow us to maintain
        our Emacs Tempo.

      - Press C-M-k now to kill the decoys A and B.

      - Press C-x u to undo the killing.

    NOTES: To maintain your 'Emacs Tempo' when using arguments BE SURE to use
           the same base keybinding for passing the numeric argument as the
           actual command.

ALPHA BRAVO CHARLIE

DELTA (Decoy A) (Decoy B) (Decoy C) (Decoy D)

02) Passing negative arguments to a command:

    Description: To pass a negative argument to an Emacs command you must
                 use the first part of the command (as we did on the 
                 ORDERS #01) but instead of typing a number, we type the
                 '-' symbol first, and then we type a number (first the
                 sign, second the number).

    ORDERS:
      - Read all instructions first.

      - On the DELTA line press C-e.

      - Press 'C-M--' (that's Control-Alt-minus) and watch the minibuffer,
        the text 'C-u --' appears in the minibuffer.

      - Press the number '2', the text 'C-u -2-' is displayed on the
        minibuffer.

      - Press C-M-k to kill the decoys C and D.

      - Press C-x u to undo the killing.

      - On the DELTA line press C-e and the press 'C-M--' again.

      - This time do not type any number but press C-M-k. The D decoy is
        killed, when you only type the '-' symbol it is equivalent to '-1'.

Good Job soldier, you can now take 3 minutes off ...
