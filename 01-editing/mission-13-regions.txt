Mission #13: Firing Squad
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Briefing
............................................................................

On this mission you will learn how to copy regions and how to use the
kill ring.

Definitions
............................................................................

Region: Text contained between the point and the mark (selected text).

Kill Ring: Special area where every killed text is added.

Mission
............................................................................

01) Cycling through the kill ring

    Keybinding: M-y => Cycle the kill ring entries.

    ORDERS:
      - Read all orders.

      - Go to the ALPHA line and press C-a.

|     - Press M-d to kill the ALPHA word.

      - Go to the BRAVO line and press C-a.

      - Press M-d to kill the BRAVO word.

      - Go to the CHARLIE line and press C-a.

      - Press M-d to kill the CHARLIE word.

      - Go to the DELTA line and press C-e.

      - Press C-y to paste the last killed text, in this case the text
        'CHARLIE'.

      - Press M-y once and observe what happens, What happens? The word
        'BRAVO' is displayed instead of 'CHARLIE', that happens because
        we are cycling through the kill ring (circular stack).

      - Press M-y again to display the word 'ALPHA'.

      - And press M-y one more to time to display 'CHARLIE' again, here we
        reach the end of the kill ring and start from the beginning.

ALPHA this is trash

BRAVO

CHARLIE

DELTA

02) The kill ring current entry:

    Description: Consider your last sequence of movements: You killed the
                 word ALPHA with M-d and then went down one line down with
                 C-n, then killed the word BRAVO with M-d again and went
                 down another line with C-n, and so on.

                 The combination of those two commands (M-d and C-n) adds
                 a new entry on the kill ring, each one of this entries
                 were the ones we cycle with M-y on the previous ORDERS.

                 But, Could we add all words to a single entry on the kill
                 ring? Could we add an enormous amount of text to a single
                 entry on the kill ring? YES WE CAN.

    Keybinding: C-M-w => Append to the kill ring current entry.

    ORDERS:
      - Read all instructions first.

      - Go to the ECHO line.

      - Press C-S-<BACKSPACE> to kill the current line, now on the kill ring
        there is a NEW entry with the text 'ECHO'.

      - Press C-S-<BACKSPACE> again to kill the word 'FOXTROT', on the kill
        ring entry the text is now 'ECHO FOXTROT'.

      - Press C-S-<BACKSPACE> to kill the word 'GOLF', on the kill ring entry
        the text now is 'ECHO FOXTROT GOLF'.

      - Press C-y and observe what happens, What happens? All the
        three words were pasted together and not separated as on the
        previous ORDERS. Why is that? Emacs appends any text killed
        by succesive kill commands calls on a SINGLE ENTRY, but if you
        DO ANY command that is NOT a kill command (like moving one line down
        with C-n), then Emacs will create a new entry on the kill ring.

      - To kill the next line (HOTEL) you will have to press C-n to
        move to the next line, BUT DOING THAT WILL CREATE A NEW entry
        on the KILL RING (like before) and what WE WANT HERE is to use
        a SINGLE ENTRY on the kill ring. We want to use the same entry
        that currently holds the text 'ECHO FOXTROT GOLF' and append
        the text 'HOTEL' to it. In order to to that, press C-n to
        move to the HOTEL line.

      - NOW we gonna tell Emacs that we want to append text to the
        current entry on the kill ring and knowing that, Emacs WILL NOT
        create a new entry but append to the existing one. Press C-M-w
        now and watch the minibuffer, the text 'If the next command is
        a kill, it will append' appears on it. That's the way to tell
        Emacs to append and not to create a new entry.

      - Press C-S-<BACKSPACE> to kill the HOTEL line.

      - Now press C-y to yank all lines together, note that the HOTEL
        line was appended to the other three lines and not added to a new
        entry on the kill ring.

ECHO
FOXTROT
GOLF

HOTEL

        'Mark activated' must appear on the minibuffer.

we are the masters of our enemy, we are the saviors of my life. So be it,
until there is no enemy, but peace. Amen.
