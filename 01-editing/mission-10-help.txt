EMACS BOOTCAMP

Hello recruit and welcome to the Emacs bootcamp program.

to specialize your abilities.

Mission #10: Search for help SOLDIER!!!

Briefing
............................................................................

On this mission we will learn how to ask Emacs for help or information.

"The long-term goal of any Emacs user is to reach the point where they
can seek answers to questions they have by asking Emacs. Eventually,
you'll commit to muscle memory the commands and keys you use most
frequently, and the rest, well you can always look them" - Mastering Emacs.
