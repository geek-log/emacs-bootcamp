EMACS BOOTCAMP
============================================================================

Hello recruit and welcome to the Emacs bootcamp program.

Now that you can run all the laps without losing your breath we'll advance
to specialize your abilities.

Mission #11: Kill them soldier!!!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Briefing
............................................................................

On this mission you will learn how to kill and yank.

On Emacs (for historical reasons), the cut command is know as 'kill'.

On Emacs, the paste command is know as 'yank'.

The difference between cut and kill is that a 'cut' cuts the selected
text and a 'kill' cuts the text and also adds the 'killed' text to a space
know as the 'kill ring'.

The 'kill ring' is a special buffer where each killed text is added, so we
can reuse it later, this is similar to the 'undo ring' used on mission #01.

From all the commands included on this mission, the first two DON'T kills
the text but delete it, this means the first two commands used here will not
add anything to the 'kill ring'.

Go ahead killing and yanking soldier.
