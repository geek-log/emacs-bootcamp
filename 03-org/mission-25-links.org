----------------------------------------------------------------------------

On this mission you will learn how to manipulate links using Org-Mode.

Requirements

This mission requires the following items available:

- The file 'mission-24-tables.org'.

Mission
............................................................................

1) Using links:

   * Description

     To add a link into an org document, the following syntax is used:
     
         [[LINK][DESCRIPTION

         Or just

         [[LINK]

     Note that there is a missing ']' on the previous expressions, this
     is to prevent org from changing the display from plain text to a link.

     If the link is an internal link (an anchor), then the following
     syntax is used:

         <<my-anchor>

     Note that there is a missing '>' on the previous expression.

   * Keybindings

     - C-c C-o => If the point is on a link, save the current position
                  on the mark ring and JUMP to the link.

     - C-c & => Jump back to the saved mark.

     - C-c % => Add current position to the mark ring.

     - C-c C-l => If the point is on an empty line, inserts a link. If the
                  point is over a link, edits the link.

     - C-u C-c C-l => Insert a link to a file.

     - C-c C-x C-n => Jump to next link on the buffer.

     - C-c C-x C-p => Jump to previous link on the buffer.

   * ORDERS

     - Go to the BRAVO line and press C-a, then press C-n to put the point
       over the internal link 'my-anchor'.

     - Press C-c C-o to follow the link, the point will jump to the link
       under the ALPHA line and the text "Position saved to mark ring, go
       back with 'C-c &'" is displayed on the minibuffer.

     - Press C-c & to jump back to the saved mark.

     - Go to the CHARLIE line and press C-c % to save that position.

     - Go to the ALPHA line.

     - Press C-c & to jump to the CHARLIE line.

     - Press C-a and then C-n to move the point over the duckduckgo link.

     - Press C-c C-o, this will open this link in your default browser.

     - Go to the DELTA line and press C-n to move the point to an empty
       line.

     - Press C-c C-l, on the minibuffer the text 'Link:' is displayed,
       type the URL https://google.com and press RET.

     - Emacs will ask you for a description (or name) for the link, type the
       word 'google' and press RET, the link is created.

     - Now press C-c C-l to edit the new added link, on the minibuffer the
       text 'Link: https://google.com' is displayed, press RET to accept
       that link.

     - The text 'Description: google' is showed on the minibuffer,
       delete the word 'google' to leave an empty value and press RET.

     - Go to the ALPHA line and press C-c C-x C-n two times.

     - Press C-c C-x C-p two times.

     - Go to the ECHO line and press C-n.

     - Press C-u C-c C-l, the text 'File: ~/emacs-bootcamp/03-org/' is
       displayed on the minibuffer, type a path similar to the next:
       '~/emacs-bootcamp/03-org/mission-24-tables.org' and press RET.

     - As before Emacs will ask you for a description for the link, type
       the text 'mission-24' and press RET, the link is inserted.

     - On the new created line press C-e to go to the end of that line.

     - Press <BACKSPACE> just ONE time to delete the last ']' character of
       the link, the text '[[file:mission-24-tables.org][mission-24]' is
       showed instead of the compact link, press C-x u to undo and leave the
       link unchanged (or you can type the deleted ']' too).

     - Press C-a to go to the beggining of that line and press C-x C-o to
       follow the link that we just inserted, a new buffer will opens
       on the bottom part of Emacs with the contents of the file
       'mission-24-tables.org' file.  This command will save the current
       position into the mark ring and leave the point on the new opened
       buffer.

     - Press C-c & to jump back to the saved position.

     - Press C-x 1 to show only one window.

ALPHA
<<my-anchor>>

#+BEGIN_VERSE
This is my rifle. There are many others like it, but this one is mine. My
rifle is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master
my life. Without me, my rifle is useless. Without my rifle, I am useless.
I must fire my rifle true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy, who is
trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will. Before God
I swear this creed: my rifle and myself are defenders of my country, we are
the masters of our enemy, we are the saviors of my life. So be it, until
there is no enemy, but peace. Amen.

BRAVO

#+BEGIN_VERSE
These are great days we're living, bros. We are jolly green giants, walking
the Earth with guns. These people we wasted here today are the finest human
beings we will ever know. After we rotate back to the world, we're gonna
miss not having anyone around that's worth shooting.

1) Storing links:

   * Description

     Org Mode can store links on a special variable called
     'org-stored-links' to be pasted later using C-c C-l, but the function
     to store links 'org-store-link' does not have any keybinding associated
     to it, so we must add a custom keybinding on the Emacs 'init.el' file.

   * Keybindings

     - C-c l => Store link that can later be pasted using C-c C-l.

     - C-c C-l => Paste a stored link.

     On the stored links menu:

     - UP/DOWN => Go to previous/next stored link.

   * ORDERS

     - Press C-x 2 to divide the frame in two windows.

     - Press C-x o to jump to the lower window.

     - Press C-x C-f to visit a file, on the minibuffer type the path:
       '~/.emacs.d/init.el' and press RET, the Emacs configuration file
       opens up.

     - Add the following text to the 'init.el' file:

           (global-set-key (kbd "C-c l") 'org-store-link)

     - Save the buffer by pressing C-x C-s.

     - Close Emacs, open it up again and come back TO THIS LINE.
     
     - Press C-x 2 to divide the frame in two windows.

     - Press C-x o to jump to the lower window.

     - Press C-x C-f and visit the 'mission-24-tables.org' file.

     - When the buffer is opened, press C-c l, the text
       'Stored: file: ~/emacs-bootcamp/03-org/mission-24-tables.org' is
       displayed.

     - Press C-x 0 to leave only THIS window.

     - Go to the FOXTROT line and press C-n.

     - Press C-c C-l to paste the link, a buffer opens at the bottom of Emacs
       with the list of stored links, you can navigate through the stored
       links by pressing the UP and DOWN keys, press ONE TIME the UP key and
       then press RET.
