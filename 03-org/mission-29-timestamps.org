** Mission

*** Using Timestamps

**** Keybindings

     - C-c . => Prompts for a date and inserts a timestamp.
       
     - C-c ! => Inserts a inactive timestamp.

     - C-c < => Inserts today's date.

     - C-c C-o => Access the agenda for the given timestamp.

***** On the Agenda View for the given timestamp

      - q => Quits the Agenda timestamp view.
        
      - S-UP, S-DOWN, S-RIGHT, S-LEFT => Move on the calendar.

      - M-S-RIGHT, M-S-LEFT => Move to the next/previous month.

      - M-S-UP, M-S-DOWN => Move to the next/previous year.

      - <, > => Scroll a month on the calendar.
            
***** When the point is on a timestamp

      - S-UP, S-DOWN => Increases or decreases the year, month, day, hour or
        minute depending on the portion of the timestamp where the point is
        located.
     
**** Orders

     - Go to the ALPHA heading and press C-e.

     - Press C-c ., a calendar buffer will be opened on the bottom of Emacs.

     - Press S-RIGHT two times to change the date two days in the future.
       
     - Press RET to insert the date next to the ALPHA heading.

     - Go to the BRAVO line and press C-e.

     - Press C-c !.

     - Press S-UP two times to set the date two months in the past.

     - Press RET to insert the timestamp, but this time, as an inactive one,
       you can tell the difference between an active one by the use of '[]'
       instead of '<>'.

     - Go to the CHARLIE heading and press C-e.

     - Press C-c < to insert today's date.

     - Press M-b to put the point inside the last inserted timestamp.

     - Press C-c C-o, this opens a new buffer on the bottom of Emacs, this
       a very special buffer called AGENDA, the agenda offers different
       types of views (i.e.: by day, month, todo, ...) and acts very like
       a real agenda notebook (or even better). The point will be moved
       to this new agenda view.

     - Press the 'q' key to quit the agenda view for the timestamp.

     - Put the point on the day portion of the timestamp and press S-UP.

     can start and stop the clock anytime you want or alternatively, when
     a task is marked as 'DONE', the clock will automatically stop and the
     final time is recorded.

     It is also possible to compute the total time spended by calculating
     the times on a subtree entries (i.e. by project).

**** Keybindings

     - C-c C-x C-i => Starts the clock for the current item.
       
     - C-c C-x C-o => Inserts another timestamp on the same location where
       the clock was started before (stops the clock).

     - C-c C-x C-x => Reclock the last clocked time.

     - C-c C-x C-e => Updates the effort estimate.

     - C-c C-y => Recomputes the time.

     - C-c C-t => Changes a TODO task to DONE and stops the clock.

     - C-c C-x C-q => Cancels the current clock.

     - C-c C-x C-j => Jump to the currently clocked heading.

     - C-c C-x C-d => Displays the time of each subtree.

**** Orders
