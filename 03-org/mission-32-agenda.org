*** Agenda Files

**** Description

     In order to make the Agenda do something useful, you need two things:

     - A list of files that you want to track.
       
     - TODO items with active timestamps included on the tracked files.
       
     This way the Agenda can use the files and TODO items on them, as the
     source to build Agenda Views.

**** Keybindings

     - C-c [ => Add current file to the list of agenda files.
       
     - C-c ] => Remove current file from the list of agenda files.

     - C-' => Cycle through agenda files.

     - C-, => Cycle through agenda files.

     - C-c C-x < => Restrict the agenda to the current subtree.

     - C-c C-x > => Remove reestrictions.

**** Orders

     - Go to the BRAVO heading and press C-c [ to add this file to the
       Agenda, the text 'File added to front of agenda file list' is
       displayed on the Modeline.

     - Press C-c ], the text 'Removed from Org Agenda list: ...' is
       displayed on the Modeline.

     - Press C-c [ again to add this file as we needed for next orders.
       
     - Now the Agenda has a file to review, and this file has TODO items
       on it (at the bottom), but these TODO items don't have any timestamps
       associated yet, go and follow next orders to change that.
