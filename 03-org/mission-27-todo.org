EMACS ORG-MODE
============================================================================

Hello recruit and welcome to the Air Force where you will learn
to FLY using org-mode.

* Mission #27: TODO lists.

** Briefing

   On this mission you will learn how to use TODO lists.

   "TODO items are an integral part of the notes file, because TODO items
   usually come up while taking notes!

   With Org mode, simply mark any entry in a tree as being a TODO item. In
   this way, information is not duplicated, and the entire context from which
   the TODO item emerged is always present.

   Of course, this technique for managing TODO items scatters them throughout
   your notes file. Org mode compensates this by providing methods to give
   you an overview of all the things that you have to do." - Org Mode Manual

** Mission

*** Creating TODOs:
  
**** Description
     
     Any heading is converted into a TODO item if it starts with the word
     'TODO':

***** TODO Explain TODO items.

**** Keybindings

     - C-c C-t => Rotate the TODO state: 'unmarked', 'TODO', 'DONE'.

     - S-RIGHT / S-LEFT => Change the TODO item state.

     - C-c / t => Display all TODO items in a sparsed tree, folds all the
       buffer and show all 'TODOs' not marked as 'DONE'.

     - C-c / T => Search for a specific TODO item.

     - S-M-RET => Inserts a new TODO below the current one.

**** Orders

     - Read all orders.

     - Go to the ALPHA heading.
       
     - Press C-c C-t three times to cycle all three TODO states.
       
     - Press S-RIGHT two times to mark the ALPHA heading as a DONE item.
       
     - Press S-LEFT one time to set it as a TODO item.
       
     - Press C-c /, on the minibuffer a list of options are presented for
       you to choose.

     - Press the 't' key to display only the TODO items, this will fold
       the whole buffer and highlight the existent TODO items, you can press
       C-u C-u TAB to show all the content again.

     - Go to the ALPHA heading and press S-M-RET to insert a new TODO
       item below the ALPHA one.

**** ALPHA

     The alpha information.

***** An alpha item

*** Priority:

**** Description

     You can use the capital letters 'A', 'B' or 'C' to set the priority
     of a TODO item.

     For example the following headings:
     
***** TODO [#A] More priority. 

***** TODO [#C] Less priority.

**** Keybindings

     - C-c , => Set priority.

     - S-UP / S-DOWN => Increase/Decrease priority.

**** Orders

     - Go to the BRAVO heading.

     - Press C-c , to set the priority, Emacs will ask you for a character
       from 'A' to 'C'.

     - Type 'A', the text '[#A]' is inserted.

     - Press S-DOWN two times to set the priority to 'C'.

     - Press S-UP one time to set priority to 'B'.

**** BRAVO

*** Subtasks:

**** Description

     A TODO heading can have subtasks, for example:

***** Call Pilots

****** Call CHARLIE

****** Call Pérez

    You can break tasks in subtasks using '[/]' or '[%]' at the end of
    the TODO item, for example:

***** TODO Call Pilots [/]

****** TODO Call CHARLIE

****** TODO Call Pérez

    When a item is marked as done, it will display the amount of progress,
    the same applies if you use '%'.

***** TODO Call Pilots [1/2]

****** TODO Call CHARLIE

****** DONE Call Pérez

**** Orders

     - Go to the DELTA heading and press C-e.

     - Add the text '[%]' (whithout the single quotes).

     - Go to the FOXTROT heading.

     - Mark it as done by pressing S-LEFT, the '[%]', becomes '[50%]'.

**** TODO DELTA - Call Pilots [%]

***** TODO ECHO - Call CHARLIE

***** TODO FOXTROT - Call Pérez


*** Checkboxes:

**** Description

     On the previous orders we used a parent TODO heading (call pilots)
     and two children TODO headings (call charlie, call pérez), we can
     achieve a similar result by using a parent TODO heading and
     checkboxes items as childrens.

     You can create a checkbox item by using the text '[]' at the beginning
     of a plain list item:

         '- [ ] My checkbox'

     Using checkboxes is faster than using TODO items because checkboxes are
     not included on the global TODO list.

**** Keybindings

     - C-c C-x C-b => Toggle checkbox status.
       
     - M-S-RET => Insert a new checkbox item.

     - C-c C-x o => Toggle 'ORDERED' property, this is used if the
       checkboxes needs to be turned on using a particular sequence.

     - C-c # => Updates the 'statistic cookie'.

**** Orders

     - Go to the HOTEL line and press C-c C-x C-b.

     - Go to the INDIA heading and press C-e.
       
     - Press M-S-RET to insert a new checkbox item.
 
**** TODO GOLF [/]

     - [ ] HOTEL
       
     - [ ] INDIA
