   * ORDERS

     - Go to the BRAVO line and press C-a, then press C-n.

     - Press M-e to go to the end of that field.

     - Press M-a to go to the start of that field.

     - Press C-c <SPACE> to clear that field.

     - Press C-x u to undo.

     - With the point over 'batman' press M-RIGHT, then press M-LEFT.

     - Press M-DOWN then press M-UP.

       ordering to apply, type 'a' to choose alphabetic, the lines
       gets ordered.

   * NOTES
     - If you notice, the C-c ^ is the same keybinding that we used on
       the previous mission to order a plain list, Org mode call different
       functions using the same keybinding depending on THE CONTEXT in we
       currently are, on the previous mission THE CONTEXT was a plain
       list, on this mission THE CONTEXT is a table.
