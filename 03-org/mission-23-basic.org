EMACS ORG-MODE
============================================================================

Hello recruit and welcome to the Air Force where you will learn
to FLY using org-mode.

Mission #23: First Steps with Org-Mode
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Briefing
............................................................................

Note that this file has an ".org" extension and not a ".txt" extension like
all the previous mission files, this is because this is an "Org file".

Org files are edited using the Emacs Major Mode named "Org Mode" or
"organizational mode". If you check the Modeline (the text area above
the minibuffer), it says "(Org)".

This mode allow us to use Emacs to write and manage information in an agile
way, so it conforms to the changing flow of our thoughts (mind like water
and all that).

Org Mode has many features, some of them are:

- Handle lists of items.

- Handle todo lists.

- Handle trees and subtrees of information in a dynamic way.
  
- Handle a diary.

- Handle an agenda.

- Handle a calendar and calendar events.
  
- Use events reminders.

- Export to many formats.

- Include working blocks of code in multiple languages.

- Allows to insert multimedia.

- Handle tabular information.

On Org-mode you can create information trees by using the '*' as first
character on a line to promote that line as a heading:

 * Heading 1

If you put two asterisks (**) together as the first two characters on a line,
that line will become a second level heading:

 ** Heading 2

If you put trhee asterisk (***) as the first three charaters on a line,
that line becomes a third level heading (and so on):


 *** Heading 3

That headings and subheading structure is what conforms an information
tree (or subtree).

Mission
............................................................................

1) Cycling heading states:

   * Description
      
     Org-mode it's all about trees (or subtrees) of information,
     each node on an information subtree corresponds to a heading on an
     "Org document".

     There are multiple ways to define a heading, the most common way is to
     use the '*' symbol, another option could be use numbers to define
     a numeric list.
     
   * Keybindings

     - TAB => Cycle through heading states: folded > child > subtree.

     - C-u C-u RET => Restarts to initial visibility.

     - C-u C-u C-u RET => Show all including drawers.

   * ORDERS
    
     - Read all instructions first.
        
     - Put the point over the line that contains the '1' number.
        
     - Press TAB, the text on this ORDERS will be hidden and only the
       heading line is visible, this is the 'folded' state.
        
     - If you press TAB again more text is visible but on some lines the
       text is not fully displayed and three periods (...) are displayed
       to indicate that there are more text. This is the 'child' state.
        
     - If you press TAB a third time then all the text is showed, this is
       the 'subtree' state.

     - Now that you know how to fold things fold the set of instructions
       1 and go to set 2.

2) Inserting items:

       instructions on the current buffer (i.e.: 1), 2), 3), and so on).
