#+STARTUP: showall

EMACS ORG-MODE
============================================================================

Hello recruit and welcome to the Air Force where you will learn
to FLY using org-mode.

* Mission #26: Using Subtrees

** Briefing

   On this mission you will learn how to manipulate information subtrees.

   For this mission and the next ones, the mission file is written using
   a more org-mode format.

   The text on top of this document ('#+STARTUP: showall') is used to
   set the initial items visibility to full expanded (except for hidden
   items like drawers).

** Mission

*** Creating a subtree:
  
**** Description
     
     As stated on mission #23, you can use the '*' character to create
     headings and subheadings, and the resulting structure of headings and
     subheadings is an information subtree.

     You can create, modify, copy, paste, delete, export and import subtrees.

**** Keybindings

     - TAB => Cycle between the states 'folded' > 'child' > 'subtree' on
       the current heading (current subtree).

     - S-TAB => Cycle between the states 'folded' > 'child' > 'subtree' on
       the whole tree (all the org document).

     - C-u C-u TAB => Restarts to the startup visibility.

     - C-u C-u C-u TAB => Show all including drawers.

     - C-c C-r => Reveal command, reveals the context around the point.

     - C-c C-k => Exposes all tree headings.

     - C-c TAB => Expose all subtree direct children.

     - C-c C-x b => Show the subtree in an indirect buffer.

     - C-c C-x v => Copy the visible subtree text.

     - C-c C-n => Next visible heading.

     - C-c C-p => Previous visible heading.

     - C-c C-f => Next heading on the same level.

     - C-c C-u => One heading level up.

**** Orders

     - Go to the ALPHA heading.

     - Press TAB three times to cycle all the states: folded, child, subtree.

     - Press C-c % to set the mark, then press M-< to go to the beginning of

     - Press C-u C-u TAB to return to the initial visibility that is 'show
       all' the information except for hidden drawers. The line

     - Press C-x o to jump to that new buffer.

     - Modify the word bravo to be uppercase BRAVO.

     - Press C-x k RET to kill the buffer and C-x 1 to show only this one, if

       applied to the tree on this one.

     - On the ALPHA heading press TAB to set it to the 'folded' state.

     - Press C-c C-k to expose all subheadings of the ALPHA heading.

     - On the ALPHA heading press C-a, then press TAB to put the heading
       on the 'folded' state again.

     - Press C-c TAB, the direct child 'This is an alpha item ...' is
       displayed.
