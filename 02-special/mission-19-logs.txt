On this mission you will learn:
     - How to work with logs.
     - How to use the terminal emulator.
     - How to use the web browser EWW.

Mission
............................................................................

01) Using files in read-only:

    Keybinding: C-x C-f => Find a file.

    Keybinding: C-x C-r => Find a file as read-only.

    Keybinding: C-x C-q => Toggle read-only.

    ORDERS:
      - Press C-x C-r to find a file, visit this same file
        ('mission-19-logs.txt') and press RET.

      - Now try to write something on this buffer. Emacs won't let you
        and on the minibuffer the error message 'Buffer is read-only'
        is displayed.

      - You can turn on and off the read-only state by pressing C-x C-q,
        press C-x C-q now, the text
        'Read-only mode disable in the current buffer' is displayed on
        the minibuffer.

02) Listing matching lines only:

    Keybinding: M-x kee => Keep only the lines that matches a regular
                           expression. This command alters the original
                           buffer.

                OR

                M-x keep-lines

    Keybinding: M-s o => List only the lines that matches a regular
                         expression. This command does not alters the
                         original buffer and creates a second
                         buffer (window).

    ORDERS:
      - Read all instructions first.

      - Go to the ALPHA line and press M-x, type 'kee' and press RET. 

      - Type the regexp 'hower$' and press RET. This regular expression
        matches all lines that END WITH the text 'hower'.

      - Press C-x u to undo the keep-lines command.

      - On the ALPHA line press M-s o, the text 'List lines matching
        regexp:' is displayed on the minibuffer.

      - Type 'hower$' and press RET. A second window is opened at the
        bottom of Emacs, this window contains the list of results BUT
        DID NOT delete anything from the original 'mission-19-logs.txt'
        buffer. NOTE that the results are the same that we get with the
        keep-lines command.

      - Press C-x 1 to show only one window.

ALPHA
"In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but
planning is indispensable." - Dwight D. Eisenhower

"Neither a wise nor a brave man lies down on the tracks of history to wait
for the train of the future to run over him." - Dwight D. Eisenhower

"Leadership is the art of getting someone else to do something you want
done because he wants to do it." - Dwight D. Eisenhower

03) Highlighting:

    Keybinding: M-s h p => Highlight a phrase.

    Keybinding: M-s h r => Highlight by regular expression.

    Keybinding: M-s h . => Highlight the symbol under the point.

    Keybinding: M-s h u => Undo the highlighting under the point.

    ORDERS:
      - Go to the BRAVO line and press M-s h p, the text 'Phrase to
        highlight:' is displayed on the minibuffer.

      - Type the text 'Dwight D. Eisenhower' and press RET, the text
        'Highlight using face:' is displayed on the minibuffer, press
        RET again, the text gets highlighted.

      - On the BRAVO line press M-s h r, the text 'Regexp to highlight:'
        is displayed on the minibuffer.

      - Type the text ^".* and press RET, this is a regexp that matches
        all the lines that begins with a double quote character.

      - On the BRAVO line press C-a.

      - Press M-s h . , all the BRAVO words gets highlighted.

      - Press M-s h u, Emacs will ask you wich one of all the highlights
        you want to remove, and shows you by default the last used
        highlight (BRAVO in this case), press RET, the highlight for all
        the BRAVO word gets removed. You can continue removing
        highlights by using M-s h u IF YOU LIKE.

BRAVO
"In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but
planning is indispensable." - Dwight D. Eisenhower

"Neither a wise nor a brave man lies down on the tracks of history to wait
for the train of the future to run over him." - Dwight D. Eisenhower

"Leadership is the art of getting someone else to do something you want
done because he wants to do it." - Dwight D. Eisenhower

04) Using the terminal from Emacs:

    Keybinding: M-x term => Opens a terminal buffer.

    Keybinding: C-c C-j => Toggles term-line mode (copy paste on terminal).

    Keybinding: C-c C-k => Toggles term-char-mode (standard mode on
                           terminal buffer).

    ORDERS:
      - Read all instructions first.

      - Press C-x 2 to divide the frame in two windows.

      - Press C-x o to jump to the lower window.

      - Press M-x, type the word 'term' and press RET, the text
        'Run program: /bin/bash' appears on the minibuffer, press RET again,
        this will open a NEW TERMINAL BUFFER.

      - When you are on the terminal buffer and you try to get back to the
        upper buffer with C-x o (press it NOW), Emacs won't let yo do that,
        so how you GET OUT of a terminal buffer then?

      - If you read the message area of the terminal buffer (the area
        of text above the minibuffer) it says '(Term: char run)', this is
        the standard state for a terminal buffer, let's change it so we can
        GET OUT of there, press C-c C-j and observe the message area,
        the text is changed to '(Term: line run)'.

      - When the '(Term: line run)' state is on, is possible to use C-x o
        to jump to another window. The 'line run' state also allow us
        to copy and paste taste from and to the terminal buffer, as this
        state threats the terminal more as a buffer and less as a terminal
        (contrary to the 'char run' state). Press C-x o now to get back to
        this buffer.

      - Press C-x o again to jump to the terminal buffer.

      - On the terminal buffer type 'ls' and press RET, the list of files
        in the current directory is printed.

      - Type 'exit' on the terminal, then press C-x 0 to show only this
        buffer.

05) Using EWW, the Emacs Web Browser.

    Keybinding: M-x eww => Opens EWW web browser.

    When the point is on an EWW buffer

         M-<RET> => Opens the URL under the point on a new buffer.

         b => Save bookmark.

         B => List all bookmarks.

         d => Download the URL under the point.

         g => Reload the page.

         S => List all open EWW buffers.

         w => Copy the current URL to the kill ring.

         M-C (Capital C and not Control) => Toggle colors.

    ORDERS:
      - Press C-x 2 to divide the frame in two windows.

      - Press C-x 0 to jump to the lower windows.

      - Press M-x, type eww and press RET, the text
        'Type URL or keywords' is displayed on the minibuffer.

      - Type the URL google.com and press RET, the google search page
        will be displayed.

      - Reach to the search text box, type 'dr doom' and press RET, the
        Google results listings are displayed.

      - Presione M-x again, type eww and press RET.

      - This time instead of going to the Google search page, type the text
        'dr doom' and press RET, the search results are displayed.

      - Put the point over the Wikipedia link and press RET to visit it
        and wait for the page to load. Note that here you could press
        M-<RET> to open that URL on a new buffer and not on the same one.

      - Press the 'b' character, the text 'Bookmark this page? (yes, no)'
        is displayed on the minibuffer, type 'yes' and press RET, the text
        'Page added to bookmarks' is showed on the minibuffer.

      - Press the character 'B' to see the list of saved bookmarks, ON THE
        UPPER WINDOW A NEW BUFFER is displayed with some text like the
        following:

Doctor Doom - Wikipedia          https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Doom

     - Put the point on the Doctor Doom line and press RET to visit the
       bookmarked page.

     - Press 'B' again to show the list of EWW bookmarks and navigate to
       the 'Doctor Doom' line.

     - Press C-k to kill that line and DELETE THE BOOKMARK THAT WAY.

     - Press C-x C-k and then press C-x 1 to kill the buffer EWW and
       get back to this buffer.

06) Back to the logs:

    Keybinding: M-x a-re-m => Refresh the buffer when the file is changed.

                OR

                M-x auto-revert-mode 
                

    Keybinding: M-x a-ta => Add changes when the file change. This works
                            as the 'tail -f' terminal command.

                OR

                M-x auto-revert-tail-mode

    ORDERS:
      - Read all instructions first.

      - Press M-x, type 'a-re-m' and press RET, the text
        'Auto-Revert mode enabled for this buffer' is displayed on the
        minibuffer.

      - Press C-x 2 to divide the frame in two windows.

      - Press C-x o to jump to the lower window.

      - Press M-x, type 'term' and press RET twice, a terminal buffer is
        opened.

      - From the terminal we will change the 'mission-19-logs.txt' file, type
        the following command and press RET:

            echo 'understand maggot?' >> mission-19-logs.txt

        That command appends text to the 'mission-19-logs.txt' file.

      - Type the command 'exit' on the terminal, press RET and then
        press C-x 0 to show only this window.

      - Go to the end of the buffer pressing C-> and verify that the
        text we added is there, then press C-x C-x to return here (C-g to
        cancel the selected region).

      - Press M-x, type 'a-re-m' and press RET, the text
        'Auto-Revert mode disabled for this buffer' is displayed on the
        minibuffer.

Good job soldier, now you can take 10 minutes off ...
