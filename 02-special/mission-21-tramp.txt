EMACS BOOTCAMP
============================================================================

Hello recruit and welcome to the Special Forces training.

Here you will learn to use more advanced commands.

Mission #21: Using TRAMP
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Briefing
............................................................................

"This gotta be the greatest mission of all times." - A regular soldier.

On this mission we will:

- Setup your ssh keys.

- Install and configure KVM.

- Create a Debian Virtual Machine.

- Access the Virtual Machine via terminal buffer.

- Access the Virtual Machine via TRAMP.

Requirements
............................................................................

To complete this mission is required:

- The program 'sudo' installed.

- Access as sudo user (or root access).

Definitions
............................................................................

TRAMP: Emacs remote files editor, it is used to manage files and directories
       remotely. It allows you transparent access to files on remote access.
       "Transparent" means that usually the user doesnâ€™t have to worry about
       anything.

       The TRAMP connections use the following syntax:

           /protocol:[user@hostname[#port]]:

       Where protocol can be something like ssh, scp or sftp. When using ssh,
       TRAMP will parse your ~/.ssh/config file.

Mission
............................................................................

01) Setting up SSH:

    Description: Here we need to configure our ssh keys for everything to
                 work just fine.

    ORDERS:
     - Press C-x 2 to divide the frame in two windows.

     - Press C-x o to jump to the lower window.

     - Press M-x, type 'term' and then press RET twice to call the terminal.

     - Let's install the 'openssh-client' program that later we will use
       to access an ssh server. On the terminal buffer type the following
       command, press RET and WAIT UNTIL 'openssh-client' is installed:

           sudo apt install -y openssh-client

    - The next step is to generate a pair of ssh keys (if you don't have
      them already), on the terminal buffer type the following command and
      press RET:

          ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_user@your_mail.com"

      The program "ssh-keygen" WILL ASK you the next three questions:

Enter file in which to save the key (/home/doom/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again:

      You can press RET on all the questions, when the next text
      is showed, your keys have been created:

Your identification has been saved in /home/doom/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/doom/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

    - Let's use Dired to verify that everything is going well. On the
      terminal buffer, press C-c C-j to enable the 'line run' status,
      then press C-x d,Emacs will ASK you for a path, delete the default
      path that appears on the minibuffer, type the following path and
      press RET:

          ~/.ssh

      On Dired, you should see a listing similar to the following:

  -rw-------   1 doom doom 3401 oct 25 11:48 id_rsa
  -rw-r--r--   1 doom doom  754 oct 25 11:48 id_rsa.pub

    - Press 'q' to quit Dired.

    - Type 'exit' on the terminal buffer and press RET, then press C-x 0 to
      display only this buffer.

02) Setting up KVM, using TRAMP:

    Description: KVM or the Kernel Virtual Machine is a technology
                 to create virtual machines for Linux.

    ORDERS:
      - Read all instructions first.

      - Press C-x 2 to divide the frame in two windows.

      - Press C-x o to jump to the lower window.

      - Press M-x, type 'term' and press RET twice to show a terminal buffer.

      - On the terminal buffer type the following command and press RET:

sudo apt install -y libvirt-daemon qemu-kvm ssh-askpass virt-manager virtinst

        Type the 'sudo' password, press RET and WAIT to KVM to install.

      - Once everything is installed type the next command and press RET:

            sudo usermod -a -G kvm,libvirt,libvirt-qemu,libvirtd $(whoami)

      - To confirm that you have been added to the groups, on the terminal
        buffer type the command (and press RET):

            groups

        This will display the list of groups you are into, for example:

            doom sudo kvm libvirt libvirt-qemu libvirtd

      - We will need a Debian ISO so we are going to download one, on the
        terminal buffer type (and press RET):

            wget https://is.gd/lFsc1R -O debian.iso

        This will connect to the URL
        http://espejos.ucr.ac.cr/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/ and
        retrieve Debian netinstall, you can change that URL for other one
        if you like.

        WAIT until Debian is downloaded.

      - To be sure everything will go fine, execute the following command
        on the terminal buffer:

            su $(whoami)

        This will ask for your password, type it and press RET.

      - We will create the directory /var/lib/libvirt/isos and copy there
        the downloaded Debian ISO file to avoid permission errors on any of
        the next steps, type the following command and press RET:

            sudo mkdir /var/lib/libvirt/isos

      - And copy there the downloaded Debian ISO:

sudo cp /home/doom/emacs-bootcamp/02-special/debian.iso /var/lib/libvirt/isos

      - Now we are ready to build the Virtual Machine with Debian, run the
        following command on a terminal buffer:

virt-install --connect qemu:///system -n buster -r 2048 --vcpus=2 --disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/buster.img,size=14 -c /var/lib/libvirt/isos/debian.iso --vnc --os-type linux --os-variant debian10 --accelerate --network=bridge:virbr0 --hvm

         This will opens a popup window with the installation for Debian. GO
         and install the Virtual Debian and return here once you have
         finished doing that. BE SURE to UNMARK the option
         'Desktop Enviroment' and to MARK the option 'SSH Server' when
         you ARE ASKED during the package selection of the installation.
         WE NEED ssh on next steps to connect via TRAMP. You can also
         UNMARK the option 'Printer Server'.

         NOTE: Dr Doom used as all usernames and all passwords the word
               'debian'.

       - When Debian starts, login into it and run the following
         command:

             ip a s

         This will show an output similar to the following:

1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: enp1s0: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state DOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 18:03:73:9b:c6:03 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.122.193/24 brd 192.168.122.255 scope global dynamic enp2s0
      valid_lft 3532sec preferred_lft 3532sec

      The line we need to search is the one that says
      'inet 192.168.122.193' as this is the IP ADDRESS of our Virtual
      Debian and that we are going to use to connect to it.

    - Get out of the Virtual Debian and get back to Emacs, NOW the 
      terminal buffer is unavailable as it is running KVM. So PUT THE POINT
      ON THIS BUFFER and press C-x 1.

    - Press C-x 2 to divide the frame in two windows.

    - Press C-x o to jump to the lower window.

    - Press M-x, BUT THIS TIME instead of typing 'term', type the word
      'eshell' and press RET.

    - 'eshell' is another terminal included on Emacs, on this new
      terminal buffer type the following command (replacing virtualuser with
      the user you created during the installation) and press RET, NOTE
      that on this command WE USE the IP ADDRESS that we figured out before:

           ssh virtualuser@192.168.122.193

      When ssh asks you:

           'Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? '

      Type 'yes' and press RET, then type the password that you used during
      the Debian installation and press RET. You will be logged in via ssh
      into the Virtual Debian.

    - Now that we are inside the Virtual Debian, let's create a file here, 
      first let's check on which path are we in, type the next command
      and press RET:

          pwd

      This commands should print a path similar to the following:

          /home/debian

      Type the following command and press RET to create the file named
      'doom.txt' inside the Virtual Debian:

          echo 'Dr Doom' > doom.txt

      You can verify if the file was created by running the 'ls' command:

          debian@debian:~$ ls
          doom.txt

    - Type 'exit' and press RET to exit the 'eshell' terminal. Then press
      C-x 0 to show only this window.

    - Press C-x 2 to divide the frame in two windows.

    - Press C-x o to jump to the lower window.

    - Now we got a remote file to edit via TRAMP, press C-x C-f, delete
      all the file path displayed on the minibuffer and type this one
      instead:

          /ssh:debian@192.168.122.193:/home/debian/doom.txt

      Press RET and Emacs will ask you for an ssh password, type the
      password that you used during the Debian installation and press RET,
      a NEW buffer is opened for the file 'doom.txt' and the words 'Dr Doom'
      are showed.

    - As this buffer CORRESPONDS with a remote file (doom.txt), if we
      use any terminal command, any Dired command or any buffer creation
      command from inside this remote buffer, it will execute remotely,
      let's call Dired by pressing C-x d RET, a file listing similar to the
      following is displayed:

       /ssh:debian@192.168.122.193:/home/debian:
       total 28
       drwxr-xr-x 2 debian debian 4096 Dec 17 19:45 .
       drwxr-xr-x 3 root   root   4096 Dec 17 19:20 ..
       -rw------- 1 debian debian  224 Dec 17 19:49 .bash_history
       -rw-r--r-- 1 debian debian  220 Dec 17 19:20 .bash_logout
       -rw-r--r-- 1 debian debian 3526 Dec 17 19:20 .bashrc
       -rw-r--r-- 1 debian debian  807 Dec 17 19:20 .profile
       -rw-r--r-- 1 debian debian    8 Dec 17 19:42 doom.txt

       THAT means that we are using a local Emacs to access remote files,
       how COOL is it?

    - On the remote Dired buffer press M-x, type 'shell' and press RET twice,
      the command 'shell' executes yet another Emacs shell, this time as we
      call this command from a remote buffer, the 'shell' terminal is
      opened directly into the Virtual Debian.

      NOTE: BY THE WAY this new 'shell' buffer will be opened above this
            buffer (the one you are reading) so when you're done playing
            with this remote 'shell', type the command 'exit', press RET and
            then press C-x k RET to get back to this buffer.

    - When the point is on this buffer press C-x 1 to show only this window.

    - You can turn off the Virtual Debian by using the next command:

          sudo systemctl poweroff

    - Finally close Emacs with C-x C-c.

Good job soldier, now you can take 4 minutes off ...
